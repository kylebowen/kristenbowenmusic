  <h1>Kristen Bowen</h1>
  <p>Versitile Music Educator</p>
  <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that onyone can learn to sing or play an instrument.
    I teach students of all ages and skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    I teach Band, Choir, Musical Theatre, Orchestra, Piano, Vocals, Violin, Viola,
    Cello, Bass, and Band Instruments including Clarinet, Flute, Saxophone, Oboe,
    Trumpet, Trombone, Baritone, Tuba, and Mallet Percussion (Xylophone, Marimba,
    Vibraphone, Chimes, and Concert Bells).
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience performing and instructing various musical styles including
    Classical, Jazz, Musical Theatre, A Capella, Opera, and Pop.
  </p>

  <h3>Why do I teach?</h3>
  <p>
    Because I live for the moment when the light of understanding goes on in the
    eyes of a student. My greatest passions are Music and Teaching!
  </p>

  <h3>Why do you want me to be your next music teacher?</h3>
  <p>
    Because I am very good at what I do.
  </p>

  <h3>What do I do?</h3>
  <p>
    I draw music out of people: the willing and the not-so-willing; the talented
    and the not-yet-talented. I help them find the desire, and then give them the
    tools- and we make beautiful music together.
